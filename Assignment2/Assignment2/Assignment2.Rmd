## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

**Load the Stat2Data package and then the dataset Hawks**

```{r}
library(Stat2Data)
data("Hawks")
```

## 1. Data Wrangling

### 1.1 Select and filter

**(Q1)** Use a combination of the select() and filter() functions to generate a data frame called “hSF” which is a sub-table of the original Hawks data frame., such that
1. Your data frame should include the columns:
  a) “Wing”
  b) “Weight”
  c) “Tail”
2. Your data frame should contain a row for every hawk such that:
  a) They belong to the species of Red-Tailed         hawks
  b) They have weight at least 1kg.
3. Use the pipe operator to simplify your code.

```{r}
head(Hawks)
```
```{r}
hsF<-Hawks%>%filter(Species=='RT' & Weight>=1000)%>%select(Wing,Weight,Tail)
print(hsF)
hsFSpecies<-Hawks%>%group_by(Species)%>%summarize(n_rows=n())
print(hsFSpecies)
```
**(Q2)** How many variables does the data frame hSF have? What would you say to communicate this information to a Machine Learning practitioner?

Variables:3--Wing,Weight,Tail
Examples:398
```{r}
hsF%>%summarize(n_rows=n())
```


### 1.2 The arrange function

**(Q1)** Use the arrange() function to sort the hSF data frame created in the previous section so that the rows appear in order of increasing wing span.
Then use the head command to print out the top five rows of your sorted data frame.

```{r}
head(hsF%>%arrange(Wing),5)
```

### 1.3 Join and rename functions

The species of Hawks within the data frame have been indicated via a two-letter code (e.g., RT, CH, SS).
The correspondence between these codes and the full names is given by the following data frame:
|species_code|species_name_full|
|------------|-----------------|
|CH |Cooper's|
|RT |Red-tailed|
|SS |Sharp-shinned|

**(Q1)**  Use data.frame() to create a data frame that is called hawkSpeciesNameCodes and is the same as the above data frame (i.e., containing the correspondence between codes and the full species names).

```{r}
species_code<-c("CH","RT","SS")
species_name_full<-c("Cooper's","Red-tailed","Sharp-shinned")
hawkSpeciesNameCodes<-data.frame(species_code,species_name_full)
print(hawkSpeciesNameCodes)
```

**(Q2)** Use a combination of the functions *left_join()*, the *rename()* and the *select()* functions to create a new data frame called “hawksFullName” which is the same as the “Hawks” data frame except that the Species column contains the full names rather than the two-letter codes.

```{r}
print(hawkSpeciesNameCodes)
hawkSpecies2<-hawkSpeciesNameCodes%>%rename(Species=species_code)
print(hawkSpeciesNameCodes)
hawksFullName<-left_join(Hawks,hawkSpecies2)%>%select(-Species)%>%rename(Species=species_name_full)
#如果是right_join的话结果有区别吗
hawksFullName2<-right_join(Hawks,hawkSpecies2)%>%select(-Species)
print(hawksFullName)
print(hawksFullName2)

```

**(Q3)** Use a combination of the *head()* and *select()* functions to print out the top seven rows of the columns “Species”, “Wing” and “Weight” of the data frame called “hawksFullName”. Do this without modifying the data frame you just created.

```{r}
hawksFullName%>%select(Species,Wing,Weight)%>%head(7)
```
right_join 和left_join没有区别因为Species只有三种

### 1.4 The mutate function
Suppose that the fictitious “Healthy Hawks Society”1 has proposed a new measure called the “bird BMI” which attempts to measure the mass of a hawk standardized by their wing span. The “bird BMI” is equal to the weight of the hawk (in grams) divided by their wing span (in millimeters) squared. That is,
$Bird-BMI := 1000 × Weight/(Wingspan)^2$

**(Q1)** Use the *mutate()*, *select()* and *arrange()* functions to create a new data frame called “hawksWithBMI” which has the same number of rows as the original Hawks data frame but only two columns -one with their Species and one with their “bird BMI”. Also, arrange the rows in descending order of “bird BMI”. The top 8 rows of your data frame should look something like this:

```{r}
hawksWithBMI<-Hawks%>%mutate(bird_BMI=1000*Weight/Wing^2)%>%select(Species,bird_BMI)%>%arrange(desc(bird_BMI))
print(head(hawksWithBMI,8))
```

### 1.5 Summarize and group-by functions
Using the data frame “hawksFullName”, from problem 3 above, to do the following tasks:

**(Q1)** In combination with the *summarize()* and the *group_by functions*, create a summary table, broken down by Hawk species, which contains the following summary quantities:
  1. The number of rows (num_rows);
  2. The average wing span in centimeters (mn_wing);
  3. The median wing span in centimeters (nd_wing);
  4. The trimmed average wing span in centimeters with trim=0.1, i.e., the mean of the numbers after the 10% largest and the 10% smallest values being removed (t_mn_wing);
  5. The biggest ratio between wing span and tail length (b_wt_ratio).
```{r}
hawksFullName%>%group_by(Species)%>%summarize(num_rows=n(),mn_wing=round(mean(Wing),digits=0),nd_wing=median(Wing,na.rm=TRUE),t_mn_wing=round(mean(Wing,trim=0.1),digits=0),b_wt_ratio=round(max(Wing/Tail,na.rm=TRUE),digits=2))
```

**(Q2)**  Next create a summary table of the following form: Your summary table will show the number of missing values, broken down by species, for the columns Wing, Weight, Culmen, Hallux, Tail, StandardTail,Tarsus, and Crop. You can complete this task by combining the *select()*, *group_by()*, *summarize()*,*across()*, *everything()*, *sum()* and *is.na()* functions.

```{r}
hawksFullName%>%group_by(Species)%>%summarize(across(everything(),~sum(is.na(.x))))%>%select(Species,Wing,Weight,Culmen,Hallux,Tail,StandardTail,Tarsus,Crop)
```

## 2.Tidy data and iteration

### 2.1 Missing data and iteration

**(Q1)** The following function performs imputation by mean. What library do we need to load to run this function?
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
impute_by_mean<-function(x){
  mu<-mean(x,na.rm=1) # first compute the mean of x
  impute_f<-function(z){ # coordinate-wise imputation
  if(is.na(z)){
  return(mu) # if z is na replace with mean
  }else{
  return(z) # otherwise leave in place
  } }
  return(map_dbl(x,impute_f)) # apply the map function to impute across vector
}
```

**(Q2)** Create a function called *impute_by_median* which imputes missing values based on the median of the sample, rather than the mean.

```{r}
impute_by_median<-function(x){
  mu<-median(x,na.rm=TRUE)
  impute_median<-function(z){
    if(is.na(z)){
      return(mu)
    }else{
      return(z)
    }
  }
  return(map_dbl(x,impute_median))
}
v<-c(1,2,NA,4)
c(impute_by_median(v))
```

**(Q3)** Next generate a data frame with two variables x and y. For our first variable x we have a sequence (x1, x2, · · · , xn) where x1 = 0, xn = 10 and for each i = 1, · · · , n − 1, xi+1 = xi + 0.1. For our second variable y we set yi = 5xi + 1 for i = 1, · · · , n. Generate data of this form and place within a data frame called df_xy
```{r}
x<-c(seq(0,10,0.1))
z<-function(x){
  result<-5*x+1
  return(result)
}
y<-map_dbl(x,z)
df_xy<-data.frame(x,y)
df_xy%>%head(5)
```

The map2() function is similar to the map() function but iterates over two variables in parallel rather than one. You can learn more here https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html. The following simple example shows you how map2_dbl() can be combined with the mutate() function.

```{r}
x<-c(seq(0,10,0.1))
l<-function(x){
  result<-5*x+1
  return(result)
}
h<-function(x,y){
  result<-x+y
  return(result)
}
y<-map_dbl(x,l)
z<-map2_dbl(x,y,h)
df_xyz<-data.frame(x,y,z)
df_xyz%>%head(5)

```

**(Q4)** We will now use map2_dbl() to generate a new data frame with missing data.
* First create a function *sometimes_missing* with two arguments: index and value. The function should return NA if index is divisible by 5 and returns value otherwise.
```{r}
sometimes_missing<-function(i,v){
  if(i%%5==0){
    return(NA)
  }else{
    return(v)
  }
}
print(sometimes_missing(14,25))
print(sometimes_missing(15,25))

```
Next generate a new data frame called *df_xy_missing* with *two variables x and y*, but some missing data. For the first variable x we have a sequence (x1, · · · , xn), which is precisely the same as with df_xy. For the second variable y we have a sequence (y1, · · · , yn) where yi = NA if i is divisible by 5 and otherwise yi = 5xi + 1.
To generate the data frame d_xy_missing you may want to make use of the functions row_number(),
map2_dbl(), mutate() as well as sometimes_missing().
Check that the first ten rows of your data frame are as follows:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
x<-c(seq(0,10,0.1))
sometimes_missing<-function(i,v){
    if(i%%5==0){
      return(NA)
    }else{
      return(5*v+1)
    }
}
y<-map2_dbl(row_number(x),x,sometimes_missing)
df_xy_missing<-data.frame(x,y)
df_xy_missing%>%head(10)
```
**(Q5)** Create a new data frame df_xy_imputed with two variables x and y. For the first variable x we have a sequence (x1, · · · , xn), which is precisely the same as with df_xy. For the second variable y we have a sequence (y1′ , · · · , y′n) which is formed from (y1, · · · , yn) by imputing any missing values with the median.
To generate *df_xy_imputed* from *df_xy_missing* by applying a combination of the functions mutate() and
impute_by_median().
```{r}
df_vy_imputed<-df_xy_missing%>%mutate(y=impute_by_median(y))%>%head(6)
print(df_vy_imputed)
```

### 2.2 Tidying data with pivot functions

In this task you will read in data from a spreadsheet and apply some data wrangling tasks to tidy that data.
First download the excel spreadsheet entitled “HockeyLeague.xlsx”. The excel file contains two spread-sheets- one with the wins for each team and one with the losses for each team. To read this spreadsheet into R we shall make use of the *readxl* library. You may need to install the library:
install.packages(“readxl”)

* The following code shows how to read in a sheet within an excel file as a data frame. You will need to edit the *folder_path* variable to be the directory which contains your copy of the spreadsheet
```{r}
library(readxl)
folder_path<-'/Users/yujiewang/MyProjects/R_Projects/Assignment2/Assignment2/'
file_name<-"HockeyLeague.xlsx"
file_path<-paste(folder_path,file_name,sep="")
wins_data_frame<-read_excel(file_path,sheet="Wins")
# read of a sheet from an xl file
```

```{r}
wins_data_frame%>%select(1:5)%>%head(3)
```
A cell value of the form “a of b” means that games were won out of a total of b for that season. For example,the element for the “Ducks” row of the “1990” column is “30 of 50” meaning that 30 out of 50 games were won that season.

**(Q1)** Now apply your data wrangling skills to transform the *“wins_data_frame”* data frame object into a data frame called *“wins_tidy”* which contains the same information but has just four columns entitled “Team”, “Year”, “Wins”, “Total”. The “Team” column should contain the team name, the “Year” column should contain the year, the “Wins” column should contain the number of wins for that season and the “Total” column the total number of games for that season. The first column should be of character type
and the remaining columns should be of integer type. You can do this by combining the following functions:
rename(), pivot_longer(), mutate() and separate().
```{r}
wins_tidy<-wins_data_frame%>%rename(Team=...1)%>%pivot_longer(-all_of('Team'),names_to="Year",values_to="Wins_Total")%>%separate(Wins_Total,into=c("Wins","Total"),sep="of",convert=TRUE)
```


```{r}
wins_tidy%>%dim()
```

```{r}
wins_tidy%>%head(5)
```

**(Q2)** The “HockeyLeague.xlsx” also contains a sheet with the losses for each team by season. Apply
a similar procedure to read the data from this sheet and transform that data into a data frame called
6 “losses_tidy” with four columns: “Team”, “Year”, “Losses”, “Total” which are similar to those in the
“wins_tidy” data frame except for the “Losses” column gives the number of losses for a given season and
team, rather than the number of losses.
```{r}
Losses_game<-read_excel(file_path,sheet="Losses")
Losses_game%>%head(10)
```
```{r}
# "convert=TRUE"很重要
Losses_tidy<-Losses_game%>%rename(Team=...1)%>%pivot_longer(-all_of('Team'),names_to="Year",values_to="Losses_Total")%>%separate(Losses_Total,into=c("Losses","Total"),sep="of",convert=TRUE)
Losses_tidy%>%head(5)
```
You may notice that the number of wins plus the number of losses for a given team, in a given year does not add up to the total. This is because some of the games are neither wins nor losses but draws. That is, for a given year the number of draws is equal to the total number of games minus the sum of the wins and losses.

**(Q3)** Now combine your two data frames, “wins_tidy” and “losses_tidy”, into a single data frame entitled “hockey_df” which has 248 rows and 9 columns: A “Team” column which gives the name of the team as a character, the “Year” column which gives the season year, the “Wins” column which gives the number of wins for that team in the given year, the “Losses” column which gives the number of losses for that team in the given year and the “Draws” column which gives the number of draws for that team in the given year, the “Wins_rt” which gives the wins as a proportion of the total number of games (ie. Wins/Total) and similarly the “Losses_rt” and the “Draws_rt” which gives the losses and draws as a proportion of the total, respectively. To do this you can make use of the mutate() function. You may also want to utilise the across() function for a slightly neater solution.

```{r}
# 考虑如何将double转为int并保留两位小数
hockey_df<-wins_tidy%>%full_join(Losses_tidy)%>%mutate(Draws=Total-Wins-Losses,Wins_rt=Wins/Total,Losses_rt=Losses/Total,Draws_rt=1-Wins_rt-Losses_rt)
print(hockey_df)
```

**(Q4)** To conclude this task generate a summary data frame which displays, for each team, the median win rate, the mean win rate, the median loss rate, the mean loss rate, the median draw rate and the mean draw rate. The number of rows in your summary should equal the number of teams. These should be sorted
in descending order or median win rate. You may want to make use of the following functions: select(),
group_by(), across(), arrange().

```{r}
#保留两位小数
library(dplyr)
hockey_summary_data<-hockey_df%>%group_by(Team)%>%summarize(W_md=median(Wins_rt),W_mn=mean(Wins_rt),L_md=median(Losses_rt),L_mn=mean(Losses_rt),D_md=median(Draws_rt),D_mn=mean(Draws_rt))%>%select(Team,W_md,W_mn,L_md,L_mn,D_md,D_mn)%>%group_by(Team)%>%arrange(desc(W_md))
print(hockey_summary_data)
```

## 3.Visualisation

We will reuse the data wins_tidy obtained above to do visualisation.

**(Q1)** Use a combination of the functions filter(), ggplot() and geom_histogram to create a histogram plot of the *Wins of Ducks* within data frame wins_tidy with bin widths of 3.

```{r}
wins_ducks<-wins_tidy%>%filter(Team=="Ducks")
univar_plot<-ggplot(data=wins_ducks,aes(x=Wins))+xlab("wins")+ylab("Count")
univar_plot+geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```
**(Q2)** Similar to (Q1), use the geom_density() function to create two density plots, with parameters adjust=0.5 and adjust=2, respectively.
```{r}
univar_plot+geom_density(adjust=0.5)
```
```{r}
univar_plot+geom_density(adjust=2)
```
**the difference between the two plots?**

**(Q3)** Next, let’s create a bivariate plot. First, from *wins_tidy*, create a data frame called wins_teams with
columns: Year, Ducks, Eagles, as well as the other teams. For example, the column Ducks represent the Wins of the team Ducks for different years. You can use a combination of select and pivot_wider to do so.
```{r}
wins_team<-wins_tidy%>%pivot_wider(names_from = Team,values_from=Wins)%>%select(-Total)
wins_team
```
Then from wins_team, use *geom_point()* to create a scatter plot, the x-axis is the Wins of Ducks, and the y-axis is the Wins of Eagles.

```{r}
bivariate_plot<-ggplot(data=wins_team,aes(x=Ducks,y=Eagles))+xlab("Ducks")+ylab("Eagles")
bivariate_plot+geom_point(size=1)
```
