# 1. Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Stat2Data)
data("Hawks")
```

-   Use Hawks dataset:

```{r}
head(Hawks)
```

## 1.1 (Q1)

-   Let's start by computing some *location estimators* for Hawks' Tail.

1.  create a vector called HawksTail, the elements of which are from the
    Tail column of Hawks data frame.

```{r}
HawksTail<-Hawks%>%select(Tail)%>%unlist()%>%as.vector()
```

2.  use the mean and median functions to compute the sample mean and
    sample median from the vector HawksTail.

```{r}
HawksTail_mean<-mean(HawksTail,na.rm=TRUE)
HawksTail_median<-median(HawksTail,na.rm=TRUE)
print("HawksTail's mean is:")
print(HawksTail_mean)
print("HawksTail's median is:")
print(HawksTail_median)
```

## 1.2 (Q1)

1.  a combination of the summarise(), mean() and median() to compute the
    sample mean, sample median and trimmed sample mean (with q = 0.5)

2.  the Hawk's wing length and Hawk's weight (i.e., the Wing and Weight
    columns).

3.  You may need to remove the NA values.

```{r}
Hawks%>%
  summarise(Wing_mean=mean(Wing,na.rm=TRUE),
            Wing_t_mean=mean(Wing,na.rm=TRUE,trim=0.5),
            Wing_med=median(Wing,na.rm=TRUE),
            Weight_mean=mean(Weight,na.rm=TRUE),
            Weight_t_mean=mean(Weight,na.rm=TRUE,trim=0.5),
            Weight_med=median(Weight,na.rm=TRUE))
```

* What can you say by comparing the results of the median and the
    trimmed mean that you obtain?

**Answer**: The trimmed mean is equivalent to the median after removing
half percent of the data means that the median and trimmed mean is more
robust than mean.

## 1.2 (Q2)

-   Combine them with the group_by() function to obtain a breakdown by
    species.

```{r}
Hawks%>%group_by(Species)%>%
  summarise(Wing_mean=mean(Wing,na.rm=TRUE),
            Wing_t_mean=mean(Wing,na.rm=TRUE,trim=0.5),
            Wing_med=median(Wing,na.rm=TRUE),
            Weight_mean=mean(Weight,na.rm=TRUE),
            Weight_t_mean=mean(Weight,na.rm=TRUE,trim=0.5),
            Weight_med=median(Weight,na.rm=TRUE))
```

## 1.3 (Q1)

**Question:**

1.  Suppose that a variable of interest X has values $X_1,...X_n$.
    Suppose that $X_1,...,X_n$ has a sample mean A.

2.  Let a, b $\in$ R be real numbers and define a new variable
    $\tilde X$ with $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$ defined by
    $\tilde X_i = a\cdot X_i + b\:. for\: i = 1, 2,...,n$.

3.  What is the sample mean of $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$ as a function
    of a,b and A?

**Answer:** $mean\;of\; {\tilde X}=a*A+b$

**Verification:**

```{r}
a<-2
b<-3
#computed by my conclusion
HawksTailmean1<-HawksTail_mean*a+b
print(HawksTailmean1)
#computed by HawksTail separately
compute_mean<-function(x){
  return(x*a+b)
}
HawksTail1<-map_dbl(HawksTail,compute_mean)
HawksTailmean2<-mean(HawksTail1,na.rm=TRUE)
print(HawksTailmean2)
```

The two results are equivalent.

## 1.3 (Q2)

**Question:**

Suppose further that $X_1,...X_n$ has sample variance p and standard
deviation q. What is the sample variance of $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$?
What is the sample standard deviation of $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$?

**Answer:**

$Variance\:of\:\tilde X=a^2*p$

$Deviation\:of\:\tilde X=a*q$

**Verification:**

```{r}
a<-2
b<-3
HawksTail_variance<-var(HawksTail,na.rm=TRUE)
HawksTail_deviation<-sd(HawksTail,na.rm=TRUE)
#computer by my conclusion
HawksTailvariance1<-HawksTail_variance*a^2
HawksTaildeviation1<-HawksTail_deviation*a
print("computed by my answer:")
print(paste("Variance1:",HawksTailvariance1))
print(paste("Deviation1:",HawksTaildeviation1))

#computed by HawksTail separately
HawksTailvariance2<-var(HawksTail1,na.rm=TRUE)
HawksTaildeviation2<-sd(HawksTail1,na.rm=TRUE)
print("computed by new HawksTail:")
print(paste("Variance2:",HawksTailvariance2))
print(paste("Deviation2:",HawksTaildeviation2))
```

## 1.4

We begin by extracting a vector called "hal" consisting of the talon
lengths of all the hawks with any missing values removed.

```{r}
hal<-Hawks$Hallux # Extract the vector of hallux lengths
hal<-hal[!is.na(hal)] # remove ay nans
```

To investigate the effect of outliers on estimates of location we
generate a new vector called "corrupted_hall" with 10 outliers each of
value 100 created as follows:

```{r}
outlier_val<-100
num_outliers<-10
corrupted_hal<-c(hal,rep(outlier_val,times=num_outliers))
```

Compute the mean of the original sample and the corrupted sample:

```{r}
mean(hal)
```

```{r}
mean(corrupted_hal)
```

The code below generates a vector called *"means_vect"* which gives the
sample means of corrupted samples with different numbers of outliers.
More precisely, means_vect is a vector of length 1001 with the *i*-th
entry equal to the mean of a sample with i-1 outliers.

```{r}
num_outliers_vect<-seq(0,1000)
means_vect<-c()
for(num_outliers in num_outliers_vect){
  corrupted_hal<-c(hal,rep(outlier_val,times=num_outliers))
  means_vect<-c(means_vect,mean(corrupted_hal))
}

```

## 1.4 (Q1) Sample median:

Copy and modify the above code to create an additional vector called
"medians_vect" of length 1001 with the i-th entry equal to the median of
a sample "corrupted_hal" with i-1 outliers.

```{r}
medians_vect<-c()
for(num_outliers in num_outliers_vect){
  corrupted_hal<-c(hal,rep(outlier_val,times=num_outliers))
  medians_vect<-c(medians_vect,median(corrupted_hal))
}
```

## 1.4 (Q2) Sample trimmed mean:

Amend the code further to add an additional vector called "t_means_vect"
of length 1001 with the i-th entry equal to the trimmed mean of a sample
with i-1 outliers, where the trimmed mean has a trim fraction q=0.1.

```{r}
t_means_vect<-c()
for(num_outliers in num_outliers_vect){
  corrupted_hal<-c(hal,rep(outlier_val,times=num_outliers))
  t_means_vect<-c(t_means_vect,mean(corrupted_hal,trim=0.1))
}
```

## 1.4 (Q3) Visualisation

Now you should have the vectors "num_outliers_vect", "means_vect",
"medians_vect" and "t_means_vect". Combine these vectors into a data
frame with the following code.

```{r}
df_means_medians<-data.frame(num_outliers=num_outliers_vect,
                             mean=means_vect,t_mean=t_means_vect,median=medians_vect)
```

Recall that the function pivot_longer() below is used to reshape the
data.

```{r}
df_means_medians%>%
  pivot_longer(!num_outliers,names_to="Estimator",
               values_to="Value")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=num_outliers,color=Estimator,linestype=Estimator,y=Value))+
  geom_line()+xlab("Number of outliers")
```

**Question:** Which quantity is the most robust when the number of
outliers is small?

**Answer:** Median

## 1.5 (Q1)

Use the functions ggplot() and geom_boxplot() to create a box plot which
summarises the distribution of hawk weights broken down by species.

```{r}
ggplot(data=Hawks,aes(x=Species,y=Weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+xlab("Species")+ylab("Weight")
```

Note the outliers are displayed as individual dots.

## 1.5 (Q2) Quantile and boxplots

Compute the 0.25-quantile, 0.5-quantile, 0.75-quantile of the Weight
grouped by Species.

```{r}
Hawks%>%group_by(Species)%>%
  summarise(quantile025=quantile(Weight,0.25,na.rm=TRUE),
            quantile050=round(quantile(Weight,0.5,na.rm=TRUE),digits=0),
            quantile075=round(quantile(Weight,0.75,na.rm=TRUE),digits=0))
```

**Question:** Can you explain which parts of the boxplot these numbers
correspond to?

**Answer:** For CH,the top line of the rectangle corresponds to
*quantile075*,the line embeded in the rectangle corresponds to
*quantile050*, and the bottom line of the rectangle corresponds to
*quantile025*.*RT* and *SS* are same as *CH*

## 1.5 (Q3) Outliers

Create a function called "num_outliers" which computes the number of
outliers within a sample (with missing values excluded).

```{r}
num_outliers<-function(x){
  q25<-quantile(x,0.25,na.rm=TRUE)
  q75<-quantile(x,0.75,na.rm=TRUE)
  IQRrange<-IQR(x,na.rm=TRUE)
  count=0
  # Remove any nans
  outliers<-x[(x>(q75+1.5*IQRrange)|x<(q25-1.5*IQRrange))&(!is.na(x))]
  return(length(outliers))
}
num_outliers(c(0,40,60,185,NA))
```

## 1.5 (Q4) Outliers by group

Now combine your function num_outliers() with the functions group_by()
and summarise() to compute the number of outliers for the three samples
of hawk weights broken down by species.

```{r}
Hawks%>%group_by(Species)%>%
  summarise(num_outliers_weight=num_outliers(Weight))
```

## 1.6 (Q1)

Compute the covariance and correlation between the Weight and Wing of
the Hawks data.

```{r}
cov(Hawks$Weight,Hawks$Wing,use='complete.obs')
```

```{r}
cor(Hawks$Weight,Hawks$Wing,use='complete.obs')
```

## 1.6 (Q2)

**Question:** Suppose that we have a pair of variables: X with values
$X_1,...,X_n$ and Y with values $Y_1,...,Y_n$. Suppose that
$X_1,...,X_n$ relation R. Let $a,b \in R$ be real numbers and define a
new variable $\tilde X$ with $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$ defined by
$\tilde X_i = a\cdot X_i + b. for\: i = 1, 2,...,n$. In addition, Let
$c, d \in R$ be real numbers and define a new variable $\tilde Y$ with
$\tilde Y_1,...,\tilde Y_n$ defined by $\tilde Y_i = c\cdot Y_i + d$.
What is the covariance between $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$ and
$\tilde Y$ with $\tilde Y_1,...,\tilde Y_n$ (as a function of S, a, b,
c, d)? Assuming that $a\neq 0$ and $c \neq 0$, what is the correlation
between $\tilde X_1,...,\tilde X_n$ and $\tilde Y$ with
$\tilde Y_1,...,\tilde Y_n$?

**Answer:**

$The\:covariance\:between\:\tilde X\:and\:\tilde Y=a*c*S$

$The\:correlation\:between\:\tilde X\:and \:\tilde Y=R$

**Verification:**

```{r}
a<-2.4
b<-7.1
c<--1
d<-3
X<-Hawks%>%select(Weight)
Y<-Hawks%>%select(Wing)
#computed by my answer
S<-cov(X,Y,use='complete.obs')
R<-cor(X,Y,use='complete.obs')
newS<-a*c*S
newR<-R
print(paste("The covariance is:",newS))
print(paste("The correlation is:",newR))

#computed by new X and new Y
newX<-a*X+b
newY<-c*Y+d
newS_compute<-cov(newX,newY,use='complete.obs')
newR_compute<-cor(newX,newY,use='complete.obs')
print(paste("The verified covariance is:",newS))
print(paste("The verified correlation is:",newR))
```

## 2.2 (Q2) Complements, subsets and De Morgan's laws

Let $\Omega$ be a sample space. Recall that for an event
$A \subseteq \Omega$ the complement
$A^c:= \Omega\setminus A := \{w \in \Omega : w \notin A\}$.Take a pair
of events $A \subseteq \Omega$ and $B \subseteq \Omega$.

**Questions:**

1.  Can you give an expression for $(A^c)^c$ without using the notion of
    a complement?

2.  What is $\Omega ^c$?

3.  (Subsets) Show that if $A \subseteq B$, then $B^c\subseteq A^c$.

4.  (De Morgan's laws) Show that $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$.(1) Let's
    suppose we have a sequence of events
    $A_1, A_2,..., A_K \subset \Omega$. Can you write out an expression
    for $(\cap^K_{k=1}A_k)^c$?(2)

5.  (De Morgan's laws) Show that $(A \cup B)^c$ = $A^c \cap B^c$.

6.  Let's suppose we have a sequence of events
    $A_1, A_2, · · · , A_K \subset \Omega$. Can you write out an
    expression for $(\cup ^K_{k=1}A_k)^c$?

**Answers:**

1.  A

2.  $\emptyset$

3.  $A^c:=\{w\in\Omega:w\notin A\},B^c:=\{w\in\Omega:w\notin B\}$
    $A \subseteq B : =\{ w\in \Omega:w\in A \implies w\in B\}$
    $\implies \{w\in \Omega,w\notin B\implies w\notin A\}$
    $\implies B^c\subseteq A^c$

4.  (1) Proof: 

    $Let\: M=(A\cap B)^c\:and\:N=A^c\cup B^c$
    
    $x \in M \implies x \in (A \cap B)^c$
    
    $\implies x \notin (A \cap B)$
    
    $\implies x \notin A \:or\: x \notin B$
    
    $\implies x \in A^c\: or \:x \in B^c$
    
    $\implies x \in A^c \cup B^c$
    
    $\implies x \in N$
    
    Thus, $M \subset N$... (i)
    
    $y \in N \implies y \in A^c \cup B^c$
    
    $\implies y \in A^c\: or\: y \in B^c$
    
    $\implies y \notin A\:or\: y \notin B$
    
    $\implies y \notin (A \cap B)$
    
    $\implies y \in (A \cap B)^c$
    
    $\implies y \in M$
    
    Thus, $N \subset M$... (ii)
    
    Combing (i) and (ii) we get:$M=N$ means that $(A\cap B)^c=A^c\cup B^c$

(2)  $(\cap^K_{k=1}A_k)^c=A_1^c\cup A_2^c \cup A_3^c \cup ...\cup A_K^c$

5.  Proof:

    $Let \:P = (A\cup B)^c\: and \:Q = A^c \cap B^c$
    
    $Let\: x \in P ,then \: x\in P\implies x \in (A \cup B)^c$
    
    $\implies x \notin (A \cup B)$
    
    $\implies x \notin A \:and\: x \notin B$
    
    $\implies x \in A^c \:and\: x \in B^c$
    
    $\implies x \in A^c \cap B^c$
    
    $\implies x \in Q$
    
    So $P\subset Q$...(i)
    
    $y \in Q \implies y \in A^c \cap B^c$
    
    $\implies y \in A^c \:and\: y \in B^c$
    
    $\implies y \notin A \:and \:y \notin B$
    
    $\implies y \notin (A \cup B)$
    
    $\implies y \in (A \cup B)^c$
    
    $\implies y \in P$
    
    So $Q\subset P$...(ii)
    
    Combing (i) and (ii) we get:$P=Q$ means that $(A\cup B)^c=A^c\cap B^c$

6.  $(\cup ^K_{k=1}A_k)^c=A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap A_3^c \cap ...\cap A_K^c$

## 2.2 (Q3) Cardinality and the set of all subsets:

**Question:**

Suppose that $\Omega = \{w_1, w_2,...,w_K\}$ contains K elements for
some natural number K. Here $\Omega$ has cardinality K. Let E be a set
of all subsets of $\Omega$, i.e., $E := \{A|A \subset \Omega\}$. Give a
formula for the cardinality of E in terms of K.

**Answer:** $The\:cardinality\:of\:E:2^K-1$

## 2.2 (Q4) Disjointness and partitions.

Suppose we have a sample space $\Omega$, and events $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$
are subsets of $\Omega$.

**Questions:**

1.  Can you think of a set which is disjoint from every other set? That
    is, find a set $A \subseteq \Omega$ such that
    $A \cap B = \emptyset\: for\: all\: B \subseteq \Omega$.

2.  Define events $S_1:= A_1$, $S_2 = A_2\setminus A_1$,
    $S_3 = A_3\setminus (A_1 \cup A_2)$,
    $S_4 = A_4\setminus (A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3)$. Show that
    $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ form a partition of
    $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4$.

**Answers:**

1.  $\emptyset$

2.  Prove:

    $Let\:M=A_1\cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4$
    
    $Let\: x \in M\implies \{x\in A_1\: or \:x\in A_2\:or\:x\in A_3\:or\:x\in A_4\}$
    
    $S_2=A_2\setminus A_1\implies\{x\in A_2|x\notin A_1\}$
    
    $S_3=A_3\setminus (A_1\cup A_2)\implies\{x\in A_3|x\notin A_1\: and \:x\notin A_2\}$
    
    $S_4=A_4\setminus (A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3)\implies\{x\in A_4|x\notin A_1\:and\:x\notin A_2\:and\:x\notin A_3\}$
    
    $So, S_1 \:and \:S_2\:and \:S_3\:and \:S_4 \:are\: disjoint$
    
    $S_1\cup S_2\cup S_3\cup S_4=A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup A_4$
    
    Thus, $S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4$ are from a partition of
    $A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup A_4$

## 2.2 (Q5) Indicator function.

**Questions:**

Suppose we have a sample space $\Omega$, and the event A is a subset of
$\Omega$. Let $1_A$ be the indicator function of A.

1.  Write down the indicator function $1{_A{^c}}$ of $A^c$ (use $1_A$ in
    your formula).

2.  Can you find a set B whose indicator function is $1{_A{^c}}$ +
    $1_A$?

3.  Recall that $1{_{A\cap B}}$ = $1_A\cdot 1_B$ and
    $1{_{A\cup B}}=\max(1_A,1_B) = 1_A + 1_B - 1_A \cdot1_B$ for any
    $A \subseteq \Omega$ and $B \subseteq \Omega$. Combining this with
    the conclusion from Question (Q5) 1, Use indicator functions to
    prove $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$ (De Morgan's laws).

**Answers:**

1.  $1{_A{^c}}=1-1_A$

2.  $\Omega$

3.  Prove:

    $1{_A{^c}}=1-1_A$
    
    $1{_{A\cup B}}=\max(1_A, 1_B) = 1_A + 1_B - 1_A \cdot 1_B$
    
    $1_{(A\cap B)^c}=1-1_{A\cap B}=1-1_A \cdot 1_B$
    
    $1_{A^c\cup B^c}=1_{A^c}+1_{B^c}-1_{A^c}\cdot 1_{B^c}$
    
    $=1-1_A+1-1_B-(1-1_A)\cdot(1-1_B)$
    
    $=2-1_A-1_B-(1-1_B-1_A+1_A\cdot1_B)$
    
    $=2-1_A-1_B-1+1_B+1_A-1_A\cdot 1_B$
    
    $=1-1_A\cdot1_B$
    
    $=1_{(A\cap B)^c}$

  xlab("Tail(mm)")+ylab("Weight(g)")+theme_bw()
```

**Answers:**

1.  Four:(1) Tail-horizontal position (2) Weight-vertival position (3)
    Species-colour (4) Species-shape

2.  Points,Triangle,Square

3.  (1) Position (2) Shape (3) Color

## 3 (Q4) Trend lines and facet wraps:

**Questions:** Generate the following plot using the ggplot(),
geom_point(), geom_smooth() and facet_wrap() functions. Note that in the
facet plot, the three panels use different scales.

1.  What are the visual cues being used within this plot?

2.  Based on the plot below, what can we say about the relationship
    between the weight of the hawks and their tail lengths?

```{r}
ggplot(data=Hawks,aes(x=Tail,y=Weight))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Species))+
  xlab("Tail(mm)")+ylab("Weight(g)")+theme_bw()+
  geom_smooth(aes(color=Species),method="lm")+
  facet_wrap(~Species,scales="free")
```

**Answers:**

1.  (1) Position (2) Angle (3) Shade (4) Colour (5) Direction

2.  There is a positive relationship between Weight and Tail,means that
    the longer the tail is,the heavier the hawk is.

## 3 (Q5) Adding annotations

First, compute the Weight and the Tail of the heaviest hawk in the
dataset. You can use filter() and select() function to select proper
data.

Second, reuse the code that you create from Q(3), adding an arrow and an
annotation to indicate the heaviest hawk.

```{r}
heaviest_hawk<-Hawks%>%
  filter(Weight==max(Weight,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  select(Species,Weight,Tail)
heaviest_hawk
ggplot(data=Hawks,aes(x=Tail,y=Weight))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Species))+
  xlab("Tail(mm)")+ylab("Weight(g)")+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_curve(x=heaviest_hawk$Tail,xend=heaviest_hawk$Tail,
             y=heaviest_hawk$Weight-300,yend=heaviest_hawk$Weight,
             arrow=arrow(length=unit(0.1,'cm')),curvature=0.5)+
  geom_text(x=heaviest_hawk$Tail,y=heaviest_hawk$Weight-300,
            label="heaviest hawk",size=2)
```
